## Ticketmaster Music

The EPAM Team has won Devjam that took place in Hollywood with great idea that came from the Shazam-like application. The team introduced POC that connects a music-content recognition API to Ticketmaster’s Discovery and Commerce API. This allowed users to have suggestions on coming events based on what music they listen in public places.

The most common scenario is you can be listening to music and happen to like a particular song. The application will offer you tickets to see this performing artist in your town or the closest city straight away. Isn’t this great? So, from the moment you like a song up to when you are at the concert or even afterwards, Ticketmaster provides you with the best experience. 
 
The concept is written on Python with use of ACRCloud trial service for music-content recognition that allows to apply robust recognition algorithm quickly and integrate them with Ticketmaster's APIs.
