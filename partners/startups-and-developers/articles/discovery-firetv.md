## Amazon Fire TV

This is a very useful [open-source](https://github.com/gorgeorg/FireTV_POC) application for browsing events using Ticketmaster’s API. Users can find events based on their predefined location (ZIP Code) on Amazon Fire TV.

The events list appears after searching by keyword, and it is divided into categories. Detailed event info is shown after choosing one item and the user can buy a ticket using a QR-code and look at the venue on a map.
