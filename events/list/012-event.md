This year, Ticketmaster will be rolling out [more new technology](https://medium.com/ticketmaster-tech/open-platform-at-ticketmaster-e1f3b05cd417) than ever before! We want to meet with you, the developer community, to get your feedback on our redesigned developer portal and updates to our API offering before we launch them.
